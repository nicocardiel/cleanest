# cleanest

This program was initially developed as part of the `Reduceme` package
(https://github.com/nicocardiel/reduceme). Due to historical reasons, `Reduceme`
images are not stored as FITS files. For that reason, and in order to
facilitate the use of cleanest without the need to convert the images to/from
`Reduceme` to FITS format, cleanest has been detached from the `Reduceme` package
and converted in a stand-alone program.
