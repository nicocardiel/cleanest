# cleanest
Semiautomatic removal of cosmic rays

This program was initially developed as part of the reduceme package
(https://github.com/nicocardiel/reduceme). Due to historical reasons, reduceme
images are not stored as FITS files. For that reason, and in order to
facilitate the use of cleanest without the need to convert the images to/from
reduceme format to FITS, cleanest has been detached from the reduceme package
and converted in a stand-alone program.
