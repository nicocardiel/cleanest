Welcome to cleanest's documentation!
====================================

**cleanest** is a Fortran 77 program specially devoted to the semiautomatic
removal of cosmic rays in astronomical images.

This program was initially developed as part of the `REDUCEME package
<http://reduceme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.  Due to historical reasons,
REDUCEME images are not stored as FITS files. For that reason, and in order to
facilitate the use of **cleanest** without the need to convert the images
to/from REDUCEME format to FITS, **cleanest** has been detached from the
REDUCEME package and converted in a stand-alone program.

This software was created by Nicolás Cardiel as part of his thesis work,
developed under the supervision of Javier Gorgas, at the Departamento de
Astrofísica of the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. If you use this program,
