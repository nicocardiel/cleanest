Welcome to cleanest's documentation!
====================================

*cleanest* is a Fortran 77 program specially devoted to the semiautomatic
removal of cosmic rays in astronomical images.

This program was initially developed as part of the `REDUCEME package
<http://reduceme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
Due to historical reasons, REDUCEME
images are not stored as FITS files. For that reason, and in order to
facilitate the use of *cleanest* without the need to convert the images to/from
REDUCEME format to FITS, *cleanest* has been detached from the REDUCEME package
and converted in a stand-alone program.

This software was created by N. Cardiel as part of his thesis work, developed
under the supervision of J. Gorgas, at the Departamento de Astrof√≠sica of the
Universidad Complutense de Madrid.
